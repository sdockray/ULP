# Unnatural Language Processing

Documentation forthcoming, but you need [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

Also you might be prompted to install the Spacy language model, like [this](https://spacy.io/usage)

You need to:

```
cp default.settings.py settings.py
```

and add in a token and organization id.
